# The file introduces a new GitHub Action named Continuous Integration that is triggered on push,
# meaning that everytime a developer pushes a code to a branch where this file exists.
# The action then runs the following steps in the order of their definition on an ubuntu-latest container:
# 1- Check out to the current GGit branch.
# 2- Set up Python on the container.
# 3- Install the Python dependencies of the Bank Account app defined in requirements.txt.
# 4- Run the unit tests using Pytest.
